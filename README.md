# Instagram Unfollow Script

I have always been bothered with the difference between the number of people I follow and the number of people who likes what I post on Instagram so I was slightly bored and decided to unfollow whoever doesn't interact with me at all so I wrote this simple script.

## Requirements
* Python

## Instalation
```
git clone https://github.com/nemoload/instagram-unfollower.git

pip install -r requirements.txt
```

## Usage

```
python ./instagram_unfollower.py -u "yourusername" -p "yourpassword" -settings "settings.json"
```
